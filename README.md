# Unix Shell Clone

This project is a simple Unix shell clone written in C. It provides basic shell functionality such as executing commands, handling arguments, and supporting background process execution using the `&` operator.

## Features

- **Command Execution**: Supports running Unix commands in the foreground.
- **Background Processes**: Run commands in the background using the `&` symbol.
- **Interactive Shell**: Continuously prompts for input until the `exit` command is used to terminate the shell.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run the shell clone, you will need:
- A Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, etc.)
- A C compiler like `gcc`.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/InotCreative/UNIX-Shell-Clone.git
   cd UNIX-Shell-Clone
